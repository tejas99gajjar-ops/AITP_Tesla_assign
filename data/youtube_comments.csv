What car other type of car gets a smaller fuel tank the older it is? Is the warranty on Tesla 70% or below and if I read correct you could get a 70% put back in and not a new one and only in the region it was purchased in?  Correct me if I am wrong. I have no issues with EVs they just have too many issues for what I need. One being the cost to wire up electrics into my garage. Many people where I live park on the road. Reduced range as I don't want to swap my car every 5 years to get my 'fuel' tank back to capacity. Going any reasonable distance.

The current replacement on a pack is $15K, not $25… and the cost has steadily gone down every year for 12 years! But 99% have never needed a new battery pack.

- the car detects a passenger on the back and beeps when there is something moderatly heavy laying on it
- the car alarm went off a few times for no reason, disabled it
- the range in winter is awful and i mean AWFUL heating the car costs 3% to 5% battery
- driving at german autobahn speeds reduces the expected range to less then 200km which is i think about 125 miles
- for charging you need to adjust your route and sometimes you end up in the middle of nowhere

If you like remote temperature control before you get to the car, getting in the car and drive instantly without warming up the engine, smelling the first whip of the gas exhaust, no oil stain in your driveway, 360 degrees covered dash cam, driving in heavy traffic all the time, teslas may be a good option. But here in the Bay Area we are paying premium for charging both at superchargers and at home unless you have discounts or free charging some where. Owning a Tesla is getting very expensive.

Again, fake marketing because the only reason it would improve mileage ""in some"" cases because some don't keep their air in their tires at correct inflation because the air will reduce in cold weather by a few psi, thus reducing milage, where as Nitrogen is less susceptible to this, thus improving mileage because they don't under inflate in colder weather.

UgwzL4NwQtyXFFkqgQB4AaABAg,6nCw50D5TWQ,c01e9027d4c5f7fa,"First off, Teslas has gotten better and figured out ways to make things more cost effective and reliable. When it comes to weather, there is a climate control option to set up on the Tesla so the battery won’t drain and affect the car. Tesla also improved performance on tires to make it long lasting and you can find other alternatives to get cheaper tires that fit the Tesla model cars. 
If you’re complaining or making it an issue on spending $28 dollars rather than $60 on gas, something is wrong with you. 
If there is a flood and your Tesla is damaged by water, Teslas insurance covers all cost of damage or provides a new car, or even gives a discounted rate for repairs. Tesla knows the risk of the electric vehicle which is why they are constantly making upgrades and changing the cars performance. Other dealers just change the looks and features on cars but you’re technically driving the same crap at an over priced rate.
